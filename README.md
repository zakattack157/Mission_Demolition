# Mission_Demolition
 Mission_Demolition game made in Unity

Welcome the Repository for my Mission Demolition game for CS382 - Game Design. One of the main requests of this project was to implement something that would make the base game cooler than it was before, I handled this by adding different walls and slabs that act as other types of materials. For instance, I made some that resemble wood and have a lower mass so the projectile flies throught the objects faster and easier, while the stone walls and slabs have higher masses that prevent the ball from crashing through the whole castle as easily!
